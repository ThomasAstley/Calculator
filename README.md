# Calculator Program

This is a calculator program written in C++ with a GUI created using the QT plugin. Currently, it supports basic arithmetic calculations, but the goal is to implement algorithms and advanced mathematical functions in future versions.

## Installation

To use the calculator program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. If using Qt Creator, open the project file `Calculator_Qt.pro` and build the project.

4. Run the executable file generated after compilation.

## Usage

Once the program is running, you can perform basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using the GUI interface. Simply input the numbers and select the desired operation.

## Future Goals

In future versions of the program, we plan to implement the following features:

- Algorithms for more complex calculations
- Advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, and exponentiation
- Improved user interface with additional features and customization options
